Sharing makes our life happy baa, baa
The more we share the more we have baa, baa
Sharing makes our life joyful baa, baa
Sharing is a way of caring baa, baa
Baa, baa, black sheep
Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir
Three bags full
One for the master
One for the dame
And one for the little boy
Who lives down the lane
Baa, baa, white sheep
Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir
Three bags full
One for the master
One for the dame
And one for the little girl
Who lives down the lane
Baa, baa, brown sheep
Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir
Three bags full
One for the master
One for the dame
And one for the old man
Who lives down the lane
Giving, caring, sharing, helping shows your way of loving
Loving, caring, sharing, helping are our ways of living
Baa, baa, all sheep
Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir
Many bags full
Some for my master
Some for my Future
The rest for sharing
